# Veynrel product information architecture

The visible primary navigation is **Health | Findings | Discover | Recall |
Connect | Tools | Settings** (Recall and Connect appear when their ports are available).
Tools is a primary workspace tab: its existing `{ page: "tools" }` route selects
**Tools**. The Topology child route keeps **Health** selected. The [Semantic Neighborhood](semantic-neighborhood.md)
and [Global Semantic Map](global-semantic-map.md)
child routes keep **Discover** selected; the explicit source chooser and whole-index map
use the existing index without replacing Discover’s search or list workflows. All surfaces render in the existing
`VeynrelHealthView` (`veynrel-health`). Routes and setup drafts are view-local and
transient. Reopening starts on Health; no route is saved. Onboarding and Health
recovery take precedence and hide normal navigation.

Navigation and page content share a centered product shell up to 1400px, using the
available pane width minus 32px and 12px inner gutters on narrow panes.
Dashboards, grids, toolbars and maps use the available shell;
explanatory prose stays within 80ch, and Recall's focused review retains its inner
measure. The flat rail and its native horizontal overflow remain unchanged.

Normal Health orders Vault Pulse, recommendation, four Health dimensions and
current-data panels, then Vault Topology, then secondary profile controls, followed
by Semantic/Deep capability sections. On desktop, Findings by area gets two fifths
of the insights row; Last local check, Recall and Knowledge share the other three
fifths. Local-check metrics use a horizontal strip. Narrow panes collapse naturally.

The persistent `role="status"`, polite, atomic live region is visually hidden on
every route without `display: none` or `visibility: hidden`. Routine status stays
visible in its owning page. Setup errors stay beside their forms; otherwise
unrepresented note-opening, tool-launch, Finding-update, preference-save and
Health/Recall failures or incomplete results render below the rail. The live region still announces
them. Same-route scroll preservation and nearby disabled-action focus are retained.

PR #53 native verification used isolated Linux Obsidian 1.12.7 / Electron 39.8.10:
EN/RU, 320/390/768/1024/1280/1440px, dark/light/yellow accent. At 1440px the previous
1120px page wrapper had 1072px of inner content against a 1360–1372px rail; the new
1200px shell aligns both rail and page at 1152px inside its gutters. The retained
[native regression](../scripts/workspace-ui-native.mjs) checks every route, bounded
prose, accessible hidden status and the original topology loading/focus contract.
Error regressions cover note opening, Finding updates, preference saves, setup and
tool launch failures. Screen-reader speech and mobile OS behavior were not tested.

The final polish follow-up restores the seven primary tabs and verifies
320/390/768/1024/1280/1440/1600px in dark/light/yellow themes. Native usable dashboard
width grows from PR #53's 1152px to 1328px at 1440px (+15.3%) and 1400px at 1600px
(+21.5%), compared with the earlier 1072px inner shell. At 1280px, where the pane
already limited available width, it grows to 1168px; the current-data column grows
from 568px to 691px. Navigation, dimensions, insights and topology share the new
bounds. Topology precedes profile controls in DOM and visual order. The retained
native regression also checks keyboard rail access and topology scroll/focus.

## Responsibilities

| Surface | User intent | Authoritative implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Health | What needs my attention now? Structure, Connections, Recall, Knowledge | Existing Health controller, analyzers, reconciliation and Recall projection |
| Findings | Action inbox: review, dismiss, snooze, reopen | Existing FindingStore and inbox |
| Discover | Semantic exploration and Semantic Health | Existing Semantic owner and analysis port |
| Recall | Inventory, generation and native FSRS review | Existing Recall product owner and authoring adapter |
| Connect | Companion setup, mirror sync, MCP explanation and proposals | Existing Connect product adapter, Companion service and proposal review |
| Tools | Advanced/manual workflows | Explicit host launchers for existing commands/modals |
| Settings | What powers each capability? | Safe cached product snapshots and links to existing setup flows |
| Command palette / editor context menu | Fast, contextual execution | Existing command IDs, editor callbacks and public menu actions |

The primary **Tools** tab and Findings **Tools** shortcut navigate to Tools. Only
the redundant Health dashboard Tools button is removed. These entries do not launch
batch processing. The historical `ai-hub-open-panel` and `ai-batch-process`
commands still open `BatchProcessModal` directly.

## Tools catalog and host boundary

`health/toolsPort.ts` defines five explicit operations. `AIHubPlugin.getToolsPort()`
provides one adapter at workspace registration; all views share that adapter and
the existing plugin owners. Pure `toolsViewModel` data feeds `renderTools`. Neither
the model nor renderer imports the plugin, transport, engine or modal classes.

| Group / action | Delegation | Side effects disclosed before the click |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vault intelligence / Ask your Vault | `ObsidianSemanticController.openAskVault()` | Uses the semantic index and configured language model |
| Vault intelligence / Deep Audit | Shared `openAuditModeModal()` → `AuditModeModal` | Eligible note reads, bounded model input, advanced audit data/reports; mode selector retains Single Audit |
| Vault intelligence / Generate MOCs | `generateMOCsFromClusters()` | Creates/updates generated MOC notes from saved clusters; missing descriptions use the model |
| Batch processing | Exact existing `BatchProcessModal` | Multiple-note changes with existing filters, previews, presets, prompts, confirmations, backups, progress and reports |
| Legacy reports / Vault dashboard | `runVaultAudit()` | Creates report/dashboard artifacts using note metadata and the model; separate from modern Health checks |

Knowledge Health is a focused Health signal. Full Deep Audit remains an advanced
whole-vault analysis/report workflow. Opening its mode selector does not run a
Knowledge check or create a Health receipt. Opening Batch may enumerate notes for
its existing filters/preview, but does not process notes.

Editor tools are a descriptive catalog: Write with AI, Work with selected text,
Vault-aware writing, Generate Dataview and Atomize note. Users open a concrete
Markdown editor and use the command palette or existing editor context actions.
Tools never guesses or caches an editor. Small cross-references lead to Recall
for flashcards, Discover for semantic exploration, and Connect for proposals.
These are not duplicate primary tool actions.

Opening Tools only renders the catalog: no enumeration, reads, writes, network,
Health scan, Semantic work, Recall work or Connect work. Only an explicit action
calls a host operation. Tool-specific setup validation, confirmation and detailed
results remain with the existing workflow. A launcher rejection uses fixed safe
copy; retry clears it. Late rejections cannot restore a detached route. Leaving
Tools does not cancel plugin/modal-owned operations.

## Settings overview and Advanced Settings

The pure settings view model selects display fields from
`DeepIntelligenceSnapshot`, `SemanticIntelligenceSnapshot` and `ConnectSnapshot`.
It reuses their existing presentation helpers and excludes credentials, tokens,
endpoint URLs, raw errors and provider bodies. It reads no vault data and performs
no connection tests, indexing, provider requests or settings writes.

- Deep Intelligence shows status, provider and model. Configure/Change opens the
  existing Deep setup chooser in Health.
- Semantic Intelligence shows status, provider/model and vector count when Ready.
  Configure/Change opens the existing Semantic chooser in Health.
- Veynrel Connect shows its existing safe state. Open Connect navigates to Connect.
- Recall explains native, local FSRS scheduling with no third-party review plugin.
  There are no new scheduling controls or exposed FSRS weights.
- Advanced Settings explains low-level provider, output and interface options.

**Native settings entry decision:** the installed `obsidian` declarations
(`node_modules/obsidian/obsidian.d.ts`, `App` and `PluginSettingTab`) provide no
public typed operation to open and select a plugin settings tab. The product
therefore displays **Obsidian Settings → Community plugins → Veynrel**, then the
gear icon (Options), localized in EN/RU. There is no private `app.setting` access,
undocumented command execution, `any` cast, or monkeypatch in product code.

The existing Advanced tab uses one inventory for modern declarative settings and
legacy `Setting` rendering. Its groups now read:

1. Deep Intelligence — Advanced
2. Semantic Intelligence — Advanced
3. Veynrel Connect — Advanced
4. Deep Analysis — Advanced (explicitly Deep Audit tuning, not Health thresholds)
5. Writing & Output
6. Interface

The baseline inventory at `4bd9f5048a9ef605c4d2396eb00bb7842b8568a7` is captured in
`tests/fixtures/settings-ia-baseline.json`: **35 rows, 27 durable keys**. Existing
callbacks, helper methods, schema and defaults also have normalized source
contracts. Regrouping changes labels/descriptions/search aliases only; provider
semantics, get/set/save, validation, visibility and persistence are preserved.
The shared serialized settings-save queue and its Deep/Semantic/Connect concurrency
contracts are untouched. The same output folder/insertion and interface controls
remain available. Both technical and product aliases remain searchable, including
Language model/LLM, Embeddings/Semantic, Companion/Connect/endpoint/token/timeout/MCP,
Deep Audit, MOC, Atoms and Insertion.

## Compatibility and branding

All 21 command IDs and six context actions remain. Existing hotkeys and automation
keep the same IDs and callbacks; no new route command was needed. The flashcard
prompt now begins with Veynrel Recall producer framing in both languages. All
remaining prompt rules, including one-line `question::answer`, forbidden labels,
and native parser compatibility, are unchanged. The generated fixture is consumed
by the real native Recall service in regression tests.

The visible product uses Veynrel. Internal `AIHubPlugin` / `AIHubSettings`, manifest
ID `ai-knowledge-hub`, `ai-hub-*` command/CSS identifiers, storage paths, existing
protocol headers and embedding probe text remain intentionally compatible.
Historical docs, fixtures and evidence are not mass-renamed. The remaining AI Hub
console diagnostic is internal; it is not a workspace, modal, settings or command
label. No additional stale visible product branding was found in the scoped audit.

There is **no new persistence schema or migration**. The current settings fixture
loads without a write or reset. The 1.7 fixture retains the existing pre-IA
Companion vault-ID initialization when that identity is absent; regrouping adds
no migration or save. No engine, analyzer, prompt family, dependency, version,
tag or release is introduced.

The original functional redesign roadmap is complete with this IA. Remaining work
is release hardening: platform coverage, live-provider integration checks under
explicit credentials/consent, dependency maintenance, and release packaging/review.
Hidden Connections and Recall optimizer/history/decks remain outside this roadmap
completion and are not implemented here.

Verification evidence and platform limits are in [product IA verification](product-ia-verification.md).
